# Computer Science for JavaScript Challenge: Regex Tutorial 

## Summary

For this week's Challenge, we have been assigned to create a technical tutorial that explains how a particular regular expression functions. A regular expression, or regex, is a search pattern used by developers. In the tutorial, you’ll break down each part of the expression and describe what it does.

Is this Tutorial we will be analysing the,

- Matching an Email Regex:  `/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`
